# Project Proposal: Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition on Mobile Devices

## Introduction
Facial emotion recognition technology has significant applications in various fields such as security, marketing, and mental health. The objective of this project is to develop a robust, optimized model that can accurately identify human emotions from facial expressions in real-time on mobile devices.

## Problem Description
The problem to be addressed is the real-time recognition of facial emotions using mobile device cameras. This involves detecting and interpreting various facial expressions to classify emotions such as:
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Anger
- Surprise
- Disgust
- Fear
- Neutral

The main challenges include dealing with:
- Varying lighting conditions
- Different skin tones
- Orientations
- Partial occlusions

The goal is to create a model that efficiently processes these inputs and provides accurate emotion classification within the constraints of mobile device capabilities.

## Solutions Overview
The project will involve the following strategic steps to develop and optimize a facial emotion recognition model:

### Model Selection and Training
- **Architecture**: We will explore lightweight deep learning models like MobileNet and EfficientNet that are suitable for mobile deployment. These models offer a good trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, which is crucial for real-time applications.
- **Training**: The model will be trained using a combination of pre-trained weights and fine-tuning on a specific dataset focused on facial expressions like AffectNet and FER2013.

### Optimization Techniques
- **Quantization**: Applying quantization to convert the model into a format that uses less computational resources, which is ideal for mobile devices.
- **Pruning**: Removing non-critical parts of the model to reduce its size and improve operational speed without significantly compromising accuracy.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Implementing knowledge distillation to train a smaller, more efficient model that mimics a more complex pre-trained model.

### Performance Enhancement
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimizing the model to handle real-time video input without lag, ensuring smooth performance.
- **Robustness Enhancement**: Enhancing the model’s ability to handle real-world variations in facial expressions, such as those caused by different environmental conditions or camera angles.

## Data Used
The model will be trained and evaluated using the Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER-2013) dataset, which contains images categorized into seven emotion classes. This dataset is commonly used in the facial emotion recognition field and will provide a diverse set of facial expressions for training and testing the model.
